Add Your Website
----------------

### Criteria

Please check whether a website meets the following criteria before
requesting its inclusion in the directory:

 1. The website must be a personal website, where the author of the
    website has full control of its design and content.  Websites
    hosted on personal domains clearly qualify.  Websites hosted on
    services such as Neocities, GitHub Pages or Codeberg Pages also
    qualify, as these platforms allow full control over the site's
    design.  However, blogs hosted on publishing platforms such as
    Medium or Substack do not qualify.

 2. The website must contain substantive content such as articles,
    blog posts, projects or games developed by the author.  Websites
    that consist only of a CV or portfolio are not suitable for
    inclusion in our directory.  This requirement helps keep the
    directory interesting and meaningful, and prevents it from
    becoming a collection of minimal or placeholder websites with
    little value to the community.


### Add

Add the website details to [pwd.lisp][lisp] and submit a pull request.

An example entry is provided at the bottom of the [pwd.lisp][lisp]
file and can be copied and modified as a starting point.  When
creating a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

 1. Keep all website entries sorted alphabetically by name.

 2. Ensure that the bio text does not exceed 80 characters.

 3. Ensure that the bio ends with a full stop (period).

 4. If certain information is not available or should not be included,
    remove the corresponding property entirely.  For example, if no
    'about' link exists, delete the entire `:about` line from the
    entry.

Alternatively, [create an issue][ISSUES] and post the website details
in the following format:

````lisp
```
 (:name "Your first name and last name"
  :site "https://example.com/"
  :blog "https://example.com/blog/ (Only if you have a separate blog URL)"
  :feed "https://example.com/feed.xml"
  :about "https://example.com/about/"
  :now "https://example.com/now/"
  :hnuid "example (Your HN user ID)"
  :bio "A brief third-person description of yourself, not exceeding 80 characters.")
```
````

That's it!  Once you create the PR or the issue, we'll take care of
the rest.

FAQ
---

 1. How is this different from the OPML available at
    [outcoldman/hackernews-personal-blogs][outcoldman]?

    The OPML file there is more comprehensive.  It currently includes
    over 1200 RSS feeds, whereas our project only has a small number
    of entries so far.  We hope that, with contributions from
    community members, our list will grow over time.  An important
    goal of this project is to maintain the list of websites together
    as a community.

    This project also goes beyond providing an OPML file.  In addition
    to the [OPML][opml], it offers a [website][site] that lists the
    websites individually along with a short bio of each author.

 2. Why did you not start by importing
    [outcoldman/hackernews-personal-blogs][outcoldman]?

    We have not yet had the time to do so.  The [data format][lisp]
    used by this project differs from theirs and requires additional
    information for each blog entry.  Translating the existing list
    into our format therefore takes a non-trivial amount of effort,
    which we have not been able to commit to yet.

    Contributions that add entries to this project, whether sourced
    from that list or elsewhere, are very welcome.
